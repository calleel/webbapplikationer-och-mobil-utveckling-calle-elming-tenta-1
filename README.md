## How to use this project

1.  **Get started**
    Locate the folder you want to start this project from and start your code editor for example VS Code.
    Do not forget that you will need Node.js installed on your machine to run the npm commands and localhost.

    To run this project you need to install all the node_modules, i.e all the packages that the repo uses.
    You can do this by starting your terminal and entering the following command:

    ```shell
    # Installs all the packages and plugins needed to your computer
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Developing on the site**

    To see the site in your browser you will need to run the following command:

    ```shell
    # Starts a local server on your localhost:8000
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **You can now edit the site and see updates in real time**

    Your site is running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    When editing in the code, use style components for styling.

    Happy coding!


## Alternative ways to make dynamic websites

  In this project we used Gatsby.js to create a dynamic website. Gatsby which is a framework for React can be used for this purpose. 
  There are many different tools and languages to achieve this, such as React, C#, ASP.Net, Blazor, Angular etc.

  A similarity between these is that you use components to do both layout and styles. I have personally used Blazor C# which is very similar to Gatsby.
  If these components are setup correctly you can then re-use elements that will frequently appear on your site. These can be buttons, lists, blog cards etc.
  This will save time in the end, simply because you don't need to write duplicate code. It also makes it easier for a company to have their unique style and for it's employees to follow this.

  Another pro with using for example Gatsby is that it has it's own built in "Link"-element for navigating internally on the site without refreshing the whole page.
