## Why Is a Basic Understanding Important?

You don’t need to know how to code to know your website is a crucial component of your business and marketing strategies.

By understanding a few things, however, you may feel like you and your designer can have a coherent conversation – and you can more clearly express your needs.

You may believe you can simply tell a designer want you to want, and poof – like magic – it happens. Sometimes, that is the case, but when things aren’t going so smoothly, it can help to understand why.

Technology keeps marching – as it changes, it helps to know why developers might need to change your site to keep it current.

Businesses and web developers are always rethinking their design and making changes to keep up with Google updates, trending designs, and more.
### The most common order to learn is:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
